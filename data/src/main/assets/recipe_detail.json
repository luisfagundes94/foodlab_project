Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The Gerard Bertrand Gris Blanc rosé with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.",

A slight sparkle on the palate gives the wine all its freshness and bring out the fullness of fruit. The elegant finish is pleasantly fresh and mineral driven. Grenache is the king of grape varieties when it comes to making light, racy, fruity rosés in contemporary style. Grenache reveals all its suppleness and cherry aromas. Its fig and sometimes cocoa flavors, coupled with rounded sensations on the palate, make Grenache one of the great varieties of the South of France.",
